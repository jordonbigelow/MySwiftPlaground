# MySwiftPlaground
**This is a repo for myself mostly. I was given advice from a developer that told me to code myself examples of things I don't currently understand and add notes, so that I can come back and remind myself of some foundational knowledge in Swift development**
## Dates
I have always struggled with using dates, but I feel it's very important to understand how to use them, as most code will utilize dates in some form
To initialize a date instance, simply call it's initializer
`Date()`
This will encapsulate(insert a definition here) a single point in time. This point in time is independent of any local or time zone
This Date structure provies methods for comparing dates, calculating the time interval between two dates, and creating a new date from a time intervale relative to another date.
Use date values in conjunction with DateFormatter instances to create localized representations of dates and times and with Calendar instances to perform calendar arithmetic.
